This is a kernel source for MT6589

Actually the list of supported devices :
	iOCEAN X7

How to build:
cd <directory>
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/<your name>/arm-eabi-4.8/bin/arm-eabi-
export PROJECT=vanzo89_wet_jb2

You need arm-eabi-4.8 toolchain (you have to setup CROSS-COMPILE var like in build.sh)
